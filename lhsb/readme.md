#Song notes:

1. ####Over and Over Again
2. ####Yippee Kai Yay
3. ####Im Sorry God Didn't Make You Cool
4. ####Just the Same
5. ####Eudaimonia
	* If this was the opener I'd say cut it at 41 seconds.
	
	
6. ####Across the Room
	* I think the female vox could be panned hard right or left. Or have one panned hard right and then a slight delay for a double effect on the left. OR maybe a stereo delay. Something to make it spacey. Maybe slight auto-tune on one and the other 
	* 3:16 maybe pull the piano out so no piano during the organ hits. 

7. ####Sadly Sally
	* Guitar opening could be dropped
8. ####Not the Boat
	* The dropout at 3:35 is cool but it coming back in at 3:40 sounds a little like it was a mistake. 
9. ####The Last Tree in the Forest
	* If you're still not crazy about the harmonica intro, there's nothing that says you can't start at 16 seconds in - ie start the song just straight up w/ vocals. 
10. ####The Roof
